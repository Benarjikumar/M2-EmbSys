## Temparature Monitoring System
# Introduction:
In this project i want to demonostrate Temparature monetoring system.In this project How Heat monitoring system is capable of maintaining the heat  vehiles.In This Heat monetoring system  project the the  will sense is the driver has been seated or not and if the driver seated then he need to set the temperature accordingly.If  sensor will sense is the driver has been seated or not and if the driver seated then he need to set the temperature accordingly.

# REQIREMENTS:
# High level Requirements 
*  1.It should sense the Temprature.
*  2.It should have Heat Generator
*  3. It should have a Display .
 .

# LOW LEVEL REQUIREMENTS
*  11. It should have  Tem parature sensor  .
*  12. It should have Adc
*  21. It generate The heat.  
*  22. it should have Thermomodule.
*  31.It should display the Temparature.
*  32.It should have Lcd.
