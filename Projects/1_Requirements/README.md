Auto Intensity Control of Street Lights
Introduction:
In this project i want to  domenostrate  how a street light intensity can be controlled using  ldr(light  dependent Resistor  ) and Rtc(Real Time clock)  according to the time and environment.


REQIREMENTS:
High level Requirements 
•	it calculate intensity.
•	It calculates the time.
•	It should display time.
•	it should have lights



    
            Low Level Requirements for HL1
 Llr1:	  It shall have the light sensor and calculate the intensity. 
 Llr2	 :     It connects to adc.
	  
          Low Level Requirements for HL2.
 Llr1	 :    It shall clock and it calculate time
Llr2 : 	It connected to input pin

            Low Level Requirements for HL3
   Llr1:	     It have lcd and it display time	
   Llr2	:     It connect  to input

          Low Level Requirements for HL4	
          Llr1 :	It should have led relays	
            Llr2 :     It connect to port.

        Components Required
  Power supply :  it gives the  power
LDR:  Light dependent resistor is used to calculate the intensity of light
LCD:   Lcd  is  used   to  display  the  time which read from ic RTC:  Real time clock is used for to calculate the current time.
LED:   It gives the output according to the  input from the cicuits
MICROCONTROLLER:  it is  used to control  all the circuits..
