## Auto Intensity Control of Street Lights
# Introduction:
In this project i want to  domenostrate  how a street light intensity can be controlled using  ldr(light  dependent Resistor  ) and Rtc(Real Time clock)  according to the time and environment. The main Aim is to controll the  intensity in Peak hours.

 
## REQIREMENTS:
# High level Requirements 
*	1.It calculate intensity.
*	2.It calculates the time.
*	3.It should display time.
*	4.It should have lights.
 

 
## Low  level  Requirements
 * Low Level Requirements for HL1.
 11. It shall have the light sensor and calculate the intensity. 
 12. It connects to adc.
	  
# Low Level Requirements for HL2.
21. It shall clock and it calculate time
22. It connected to input pin

# Low Level Requirements for HL3
31. It have lcd and it display time	
32. It connect  to input

# Low Level Requirements for HL4	
41. It should have led relays	
42. It connect to port.

# Components Required
Power supply :    It gives the  power
LDR:              Light dependent resistor is used to calculate the intensity of light
LCD:              Lcd  is  used   to  display  the  time which read from ic
RTC:              Real time clock is used for to     calculate the current time.
LED:               It gives the output according to the  input from the cicuits
MICROCONTROLLER:   It is  used to control  all the circuits..


## 4wâ€™s and 1H?
# Where?
It should used  in traffics  and in highway roads, etc.. to control the intensity .
# What?
It  should controls  controls the light.
# When?
It will be used when we want to save the power in peak times.
# WHY?
By using this  we can save power.
# How?
WE  use  this  as  a  controller  it  control  the  intensity  of  light.



## Swoot Analysis?
# strengths?
we can control 24/7.
it detects the intensity.
# weeknees?
In some cases detects false intensity.
# oppertunites?
we can save more more power.
# Threats?
It may damages the microcontroller sometimes.
ldr may caluclates some false intensity.


# Features
* It Will help Us mostly to save the power.
* low cost.
* It is easly controlled by Itself easily according to the time in peak hours .
