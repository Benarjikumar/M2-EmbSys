## Auto Intensity Control of Street Lights
# Introduction:
In this project i want to  domenostrate  how a street light intensity can be controlled using  ldr(light  dependent Resistor  ) and Rtc(Real Time clock)  according to the time and environment.

# REQIREMENTS:
# High level Requirements 
* it calculate intensity.
* It calculates the time.
* It should display time.
* it should have Leds
# LOW LEVEL REQUIREMENTS

ID	*	Low Level Requirements for HL1	ID	Low Level Requirements for HL2
Llr1	  It shall have the light sensor and calculate the intensity.	Llr1	It shall  have clock and it calculate time  
Llr2	   It connects to adc.
	Llr2	It connected to input pin
ID	Low Level Requirements for HL3	ID	Low Level Requirements for HL4	
Llr1	It have lcd and it display time	
	Llr1	It should have led relays	
Llr1	      It connect  to input
	Llr1	     It connect to port.
	
# Components Required
* Power supply :             It  gives power to the hole circuit.
* LDR                  :     Light dependent resistor is used to calculate the intensity of light.
* LCD                   :     Lcd  is  used   to  display  the  time which read from ic .
* RTC               :           Real time clock is used for to calculate the current time.
* LED:   It gives the output according to the  input from the circuits.
* MICROCONTROLLER:  it is  used to control  all the circuits..


 


# 4wâ€™s and 1H?

* Where?
It should used  in traffics  and in highway roads, etc.. to control the intensity .
What?
It  should controls  controls the light.
* When?
it will be used when we want to save the power in peak times.
WHY?
By using this  we can save power.
* How?
WE  use  this  as  a  controller  it  control  the  intensity  of light.


## Swoot Analysis?
# strengths?
we can control 24/7.
it detects the intensity.
# Weeknees?
in some cases detects false intensity.
oppertunites?
we can save more more power.
# Threats?
It may damages the microcontroller sometimes.
ldr may caluclates some false intensity....
